                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant shift in the automotive industry
                        with the emergence and rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs). Electric vehicles, or 
                        EVs, have gained immense popularity as a more sustainable and environmentally friendly
                        alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This paradigm 
                        shift has been driven by the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat 
                        air pollution, and promote a more sustainable mode of transportation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our project on electric vehicles is designed to explore and shed light on various aspects
                        of this transformative technology. Electric vehicles use electricity stored in batteries
                        to power an electric motor, eliminating the need for gasoline or diesel fuel. This shift
                        in propulsion technology has far-reaching implications, not only for the automotive industry
                        but also for the environment, energy sector, and urban planning. The project aims to provide
                        a comprehensive understanding of the following key areas:

            <ul class="drawer">
                    <li>Lower Tailpipe Emissions: EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, which means they do not release carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), or other harmful pollutants directly into the air during operation. This can significantly reduce local air pollution in urban areas.</li>
                    <li>Grid Electricity Source: The environmental benefits of EVs depend on the source of the electricity used to charge them. If the electricity is generated from fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas, the carbon footprint of EVs may not be significantly lower than that of ICEVs. However, as the electricity grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources like wind, solar, and nuclear power, the carbon emissions associated with EVs decrease.</li>
